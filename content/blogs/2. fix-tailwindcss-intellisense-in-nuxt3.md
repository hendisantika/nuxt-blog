### Problems

I had a Nuxt3 and TailwindCSS project. which was opened in VsCode. But the problem was, in my project the tailwind
intellisense didn't working properly. I tried to reinstall the vscode tailwind extension but the problem didn't solve
properly. Later after doing some research I found
a [workaround](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense/issues/663#issuecomment-1316788128), That I am
sharing here today.

### Why It's Not working

In our nuxt project we have a `.nuxt` directory. Nuxt uses the `.nuxt/` directory in development to generate your Vue
application. And if we try to look properly there is also a file called `.nuxt/tailwind.config.cjs`, So tailwind find to
config file in the same project, one is in your root directory and another one is in you `.nuxt` directory.

### Possible Workaround

One possible solution is, In your project we call tell the extension to exclude the `.nuxt` directory. To exclude
the `.nuxt` directory in your workspace,

- Create a `/.vscode` folder in your project's root level.
- Inside `.vscode` folder add a `settings.json` file
- Copy the below code to `settings.json` file

```json
// /.vscode/settings.json
{
  "tailwindCSS.files.exclude": [
    "**/.git/**",
    "**/node_modules/**",
    "**/.hg/**",
    "**/.svn/**",
    "**/.nuxt/**"
  ]
}
```

Hopefully now tailwind intellisense start working properly.
